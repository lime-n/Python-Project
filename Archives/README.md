**Archives:**

1. The items, pipelines and settings I have used to download images from the University of Pittsburgh archives for unique and not available online (i.e. available for sale, or accessible by other libraries) book pages.

The aim's to correctly name the book pages and then read these pages into python and merge the pdfs from ascending page numbers to complete as a book. The purpose is to provide a free access to hard to get books from University Institutions on genres such as Mathematics, Physics and Logic.
