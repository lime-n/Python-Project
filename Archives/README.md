**Archives:**

Progress status of project:
- Scrape Pittsburgh Archives for images of 'Top-secret' public accessed books (not available anwhere) on Mathematics and Logic.
  - ~~Build a scraper to get onto the archive~~
  - ~~grab the number of pages, title of books~~
  - ~~Download the images and separate them into separate folders~~
  - Upload the page images and combine these to produce a complete pdf (book format)

1. The items, pipelines and settings I have used to download images from the University of Pittsburgh archives for unique and not available online (i.e. available for sale, or accessible by other libraries) book pages.

The aim's to correctly name the book pages and then read these pages into python and merge the pdfs from ascending page numbers to a complete book. The purpose is to provide a free access to hard to get books from University Institutions on genres such as Mathematics, Physics and Logic.
