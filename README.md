# Python-Project

These folders contain scripts coded in the Python-programming language. These are web-scraping techniques that involved the following skills:
- Understanding of Scrapy networking for Requests
- Combining BeautifulSoup and Json to parse web-page data within Scrapy for complex websites
- Practice and use of ItemLoaders, cb_kwargs
- The implementation of Scrapy Playwright for Javascript loading pages
- The implementation of Scrapy Splash for Javascript loading pages
- Interacting with the JSON data from a webpage 
- An automator in selenium with multithreading to auto-click and auto-fill aspects of a page.

I have built a scraper to optimally parse Instagram with SplashRequest/Scrapy.Request for optimum parsing speeds.

Additional skills I have learnt:
- Implementation of lua with splash
- Implementation of Javascript with splash

Projects in Progress:
- Scrape the Nextdoor App webpage
  - ~~I have a scraper which logs into the website~~
  - Need to find a way to imitate user activity because requests to the network tab are dynamic

- Archive: scraping book pages from sources not accessible freely to the public elsewhere. To combine these book pages into pdfs and share these with free access.
